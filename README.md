# InkCards
InkCards is a UWP app to help with memorization. It takes advantage of the Windows inking APIs to allow the user to create their flashcards using a digital pen. The user can create the cards, store them in collections and use the practice mode to learn them.

Some of the interesting pieces of the app:
- Lots of operations with ink. Saving and loading ink, intelligently scaling it, programatically changing ink colors in dark mode among others.
- Support for picture-in-picture during testing
- Uses SQLite for UWP and Entity Framework Core for storage
